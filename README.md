# HaanOS-Terminal
A very minimal version of the terminal of my operating system Haan OS. Still a work in progress. Made in C++
Here are a list of stuff you can do:

- Python (enters python)
- hsl -u linux (enter linux)
- echo [text] (says the text back)
- touch "[filename]" (create a file)
- touch "[filename]" content "[content]"
- find [filename/folder] (finds if a specified file/folder exists or not)
- rm [filename] (deletes a file)
- sudo rm [filename] (deletes a file with elevated privileges, system, user, drivers etc.)
- [filename] (used for example if you use touch and create a file called code.py. then in the content put print("Hello World!"). Simply typing code.py later will execute the python code.)

Enjoy playing around with HaanOS Terminal!
